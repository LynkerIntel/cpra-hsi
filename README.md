# CPRA HSI Modeling Task
This repo will contain code for the Habitat Suitability Modeling (HSI) task, within the CPRA / Royal Engineering project.

The processing code will be designed to facillitate these tasks:

Task 1: General Data Preprocessing & Model Conceptualization
Task 2: Calculate Transitions
Task 3: Pre-process HSI Model inputs (e.g., Bald eagle)
Task 4: Build/script HSI models 
Task 5: Run HSI models output at each timestep/period
Task 6: Visualize Output
