# CPRA HSI Modeling Task
This repo will contain code for the Habitat Suitability Modeling (HSI) task, within the CPRA / Royal Engineering project.

The processing code will be designed to facillitate these tasks:

1. General Data Preprocessing & Model Conceptualization
2. Calculate Transitions
3. Pre-process HSI Model inputs (e.g., Bald eagle)
4. Build/script HSI models 
5. Run HSI models output at each timestep/period
6. Visualize Output
